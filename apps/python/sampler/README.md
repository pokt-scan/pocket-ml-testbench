# pocket_lm_eval
Files that follow the structure of `lm-eval-harness`. The intention, for instance, is to avoid a fork.

## pocket_lm_eval - task
* **[New]** `PocketNetworkTaskManager`: A class based on `TaskManager`,  that is used to inject `pocket_args` into the `task.config.metadata`. 

## pocket_lm_eval - api
* **[New]** `PocketNetworkConfigurableTask`: A class based on `ConfigurableTask`, that retrieve samples from the sql database, based on `__id` & `uri` previously defined in `pocket_args`.

# generator

* **[New]** A functions `get_ConfigurableTask` to return only the samples based on. It seems that it will be neccesary to add also train/validations subsets samples to avoid code breaking.
